# FRONT END DEVELOPEMENT TRAINING

## P7-Kasa

Project 7 of the OPENCLASSROOMS Web Developer training program

### Context :

Kasa has been in the business of housings rentals between individuals. The company aims to completely redesign it's website.

### Objectives :

Develop the entire application and it's components using React, following the provided Figma mockups. https://www.figma.com/file/bAnXDNqRKCRRP8mY2gcb5p/UI-Design-Kasa-FR?node-id=3%3A0
Reusable components need to be created for the opening tabs and the photo carousel.

The site is composed of :

1. A homepage with a image's grid of the housing.
2. An about page who present the guidelines of the company.
3. An error/no page who capture the errors of navigation.
4. A card page who present the individual housing with specific informations.

### Functionnal Specifications :

Some clarifications on the site's features:

1. For scrolling through photos in the carousel (Carousel Component) :
   *If the user is on the first image and clicks "Previous Image", the gallery displays the last image.
   *Conversely, when the displayed image is the last one in the gallery, if the user clicks "Next Image", the gallery displays the first image.
   \*\If there's only one image, the "Next" and "Previous" buttons don't appear.

2. The carousel must always maintain the same height as indicated in the Figma mockup. Therefore, images will be cropped and centered within the image frame.

3. Collapse : by default, collapses are closed when the page initializes. If the collapse is closed, a click should open it.

### Languages Used:

HTML 5 / CSS3 / SASS/ JavaScript / React

### Acquired Skills :

Develop web application routes with React Router.
